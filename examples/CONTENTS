Different subdirectories of this examples/ directory contain examples of 
calculations that use different PSCF programs:

  Directory    Programs                          Description
  ---------    -------------------------------   -----------
   fd/         pscf_fd                           one-dimensional (CPU)
   pc/         pscf_pc1d, pscf_pc2d, pscf_pc3d   periodic  (CPU)
   pg/         pscf_pg1d, pscf_pc2d, pscf_pc3d   periodic  (GPU)

Top level subdirectories of fd1d/, pc/, and pg/ each contain
examples for different types of physical systems, e.g., subdirectory
pcNd/diblock/ contains examples for periodic phases of diblock copolymer
melts. 

Most example directories contain an executable file named "run" that 
can be used to run the example, by invoking "./run".
