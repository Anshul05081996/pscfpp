Steps to clean up and simplify regression tests in unit tests:

1) Add "command" functions to System API that represent complete commands.

Goal: Make it easier to program operations programmatically in unit tests.

Note: Many commands involve operations on wFields or cFields that are stored
as members of the system but for which the operation is implemented wholly or 
in part using methods of fieldIo, such as the sequence:

    fieldIo().readFieldsBasis(filename, wFields())
    fieldIo().convertBasisToGrid(wFields() wFieldsRGrid());
    hasWFields_ = true;
    hasCFields_ = false

Create a simple wrapper around such short sequences of operations, such as:

    System::readWBasis(filename);

New "command" functions for Pspc::System:

    readWBasis(filename);
    readWRgrid(filename);
    iterate();          
    compute();
    writeWBasis(filename);
    writeWRgrid(filename);
    writeCBasis(filename);
    writeCRgrid(filename);
    BasisToRgrid(inFilename, outFilename);
    RgridToBasis(inFilename, outFilename);
    BasisToKgrid(inFilename, outFilename);
    KgridToBasis(inFilename, outFilename);
    rhoToOmega(inFilename, outFileName);a
    outputStars(filename);
    outputWaves(filename);

2) Rewrite regression tests in pspc/tests/system/ so as to use these 
commands rather than reading commands from files that contain a single 
command. There should be no need to use command files in unit tests.

3) Re-organize the pspc/tests/system/contents/ file so that files associated
with the same or closely related examples are in the same directory.

4) Rewrite regression tests to use newly created rgridState, basisState,
rgridStateComparison and basisStateComparison functions to simplify unit
test code.


5) Write new tests, including tests for systems with solvent.
