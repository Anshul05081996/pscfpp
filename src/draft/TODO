--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8

Pspc:

Generalize AmIterator to handle open ensembles

Pspg:

Introduce simple regression tests (Anshul)

Docs:

1) Update and edit doxygen user manual documentation throughout.
At a minimum, remove all incorrect or outdated descriptions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9
----

Fd1d:

1) Add LinearSweep class analogous to that in Pspc

2) Add solvent

3) Clean up Fd1d::System::readCommands, add readEcho and command functions

Pscf:

1) Separate code to compute idemp and chi_inv from ChiInteraction.

Pspc:

1) Finish improvements to encapsulation (System w-fields)

Pspg:

1) Add Domain aggregate to make param file format same as in Pspc

2) Update FieldIo to correspond to current version in Pspc

3) Generalize AM iterator to deal correctly with open and mixed ensembles

4) Port sweep to pspg, along with tests.

5) Port solvent to pspg, along with tests.

Docs:

1) Fully document param file formats for all classes.

2) Correctly document unit cell parameters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0

Pscf:

1) Introduce a convention in Basis in which pairs of related open stars are
always listed in the same order (this helps complete the basis field API).

2) Introducing new v2.0 field file formats for basis and rgrid. 
Basis would contain the mesh. Rgrid would be output in convention C order.

Pspg:

1) Reasonably complete unit tests

2) Generalize AM iterator to use symmetry-adapted basis field format.

3) (Possible): Replace use of global variables for GPU kernel launch 
parameters.

4) Review and clean up GPU code

Tools:

1) Develop python scripts to read output files and analyze sweeps

Docs:

1) Develop read-the-docs user manual documentation.

2) Improve developer documentation regarding build system, Parameter IO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1

Pscf
-----

1) Change treatment of phases in Basis to explicitly store and manipulate
Rational number phases, compute coefficients only at the very end.

Docs
-----

1) Write a first draft of a latex algorithms and theory manual, or publish 
as an article in a computational science oriented journal.
