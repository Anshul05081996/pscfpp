Changes to implement solvents 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to code in Pscf:: and files src/pscf

1) Changes to Pscf::MixtureTmpl<TP,TS> template in src/pscf/solvers

   - Inclusion of private DArray<Solvent> solvents_ and int nSolvent_,
     and public accessor functions solvent(int id) and nSolvent()

   - Change to readParameters to read nPolymer and nSolvent and to 
     read solvent data by calling readParameterComposite(in, polymer(i))
     [Lines 213-216 of MixtureTmpl.h)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to classes in Pspc and files src/pspc

1) Creation of Pspc::Solvent class in src/pspc/solvers

   Notes:

   - Solvent is a subclass of Species. In contrast to the case of polymers,
     there is no SolventTmpl template.

   - The parent Species class defines phi_, mu_, q_ and ensemble_ private 
     data members, and associated public phi(), mu() etc. accessor functions

   - Solvent defines SetPhi and SetMu setter functions 
     (similar to PolymerTmpl)

   - Solvent defines private cField_, monomerId_ and size_ members, and 
     corresponding public accessor functions

   - Solvent::readParameters reads the monomerId_ and size_ values

   - Solvent::setDiscretization(Mesh<D> const &) allocates the cField_

   - The compute(WField const&) function computes the private cField_ and 
     q_ obtained from wField input argument.

2) Changes to the Pspc::Mixture class in src/pspc/solvers

   - In setMesh, code to call Solvent::setDiscretization for all solvents
     Lines 67-72 of Mixture.tpp

   - In compute function, loop to process solvent species, by calling
     Solvent::compute for each solvent and then adding to monomer cFields
     Lines 145-168 of Mixture.tpp

3) Changes to the Pspc::System class, in src/pspc

   - In computeFreeEnergy, added loop to compute ideal gas contributions
     to fHelhmoltz, lines 591-602 in System.tpp

   - In computeFreeEnergy, added loop to compute additional solvent
     contributions to pressure (i.e., grand-canonical free energy), 
     lines 644-655 in System.tpp

   - In outputThermo, add loop to output solvent phi and mu values,
     lines 685-698 in System.tppp

   - In initHomogeneous, add loop over solvent species
     Lines 766-779
