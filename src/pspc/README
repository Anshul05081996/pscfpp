This directory contains code specific to a pseudo-spectral implementation 
of SCFT for periodic structures. The code is based on algorithms similar 
to those used in the original Fortran PSCF code. 

Users must invoke different executable files for problems involving 
structures that are periodic in different numbers of dimensions. 
The executable programs for 1, 2 and 3 dimensionally periodic structures 
are named pscf_ps1d, and pscf_ps2d and pscf_ps3d, respectively.  
Examples of the usage of these programs are provided in the directory 
pscfpp/examples/pspc/diblock.

The usual command line usage for doing a 3D SCFT calculation (e.g., 
the one in directory examples/pspc/diblock/bcc) is to invoke

     pscf_ps3d -e -p param -c command

from the directory containing the files "param" and "command". Here, 
"param" denotes the name of a parameter file and "command" denotes 
the name of a command file.  The -e option causes the parameter file to 
be echoed to standard output as it is read.  To perform a 2D (e.g., a 
hexagonal phase) or 1D calculation (a lamellar phase), one would 
instead invoke the executable pscf_ps2d or pscf_ps1d, respectively. 

See the html documentation for information about the format of the
parameter and command files.
