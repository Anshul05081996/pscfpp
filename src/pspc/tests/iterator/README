Notes by David Morse, quick reading of source code, Oct. 13, 2021:
------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything in this directory appears to broken. We should fix or erase, and ignore in
the meantime.

  - Invoking "make all" from this directory fails with multiple errors.
  - Tests in this directory are not included in the Test.cc file in parent directory.

---------------------------
Attempted compilation:

    In testConstructor1:
    Attempted call to non-existent default constructor for AmIterator<D>

    Calls to non-existent member Basis::convertFieldDftToComponents(....)

    Call to non-existent members System:readFields, System::writeRFields

---------------------------
Unit Tests in IteratorTest: 
testConstructor1:
    Constructs AmIterator<1>

testsReadParam:
    Reads parameter file in/param.
    Note: Actual file does not seem to include an iterator block

testComputeDeviation:

    Create System<1> sys;
    Read parameter file in/param
    Create 3D periodic sys.wFieldGrid (????? Not consistent with Sys<1> ?)
    Set sys.cField that is consistent with wField

    Calls sys.iterator().computeDeviation()

testIsConverged1:

    Tests convergence of same state as in ComputeDeviation, 
    TEST_ASSERT(sys.iterator().isConverged());

testIsConverged2:

    Read parameter file in/param
    Tests convergence of another state which supposedly is not converged.
    Note: This test is not added at bottom of IteratorTest.h file. Presumbably known to be broken.

(Stopped reading in disgust)
